            <p>Feeling my way through the darkness</p>
            <p>Guided by a beating heart</p>
            <p>I can't tell where the journey will end</p>
            <p>But I know where to start</p>
            <p>They tell me I'm too young to understand</p>
            <p>They say I'm caught up in a dream</p>
            <p>Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes</p>
            <p>Well that's fine by me</p>
            <p>So wake me up when it's all over</p>
            <p>When I'm wiser and I'm older</p>
            <p>All this time I was finding myself, and I</p>
            <p>Didn't know I was lost</p>
            <p>So wake me up when it's all over</p>
            <p>When I'm wiser and I'm older</p>
            <p>All this time I was finding myself, and I</p>
            <p>Didn't know I was lost</p>
            <p>I tried carrying the weight of the world</p>
            <p>But I only have two hands</p>
            <p>Hope I get the chance to travel the world</p>
            <p>But I don't have any plans</p>
            <p>Wish that I could stay forever this young</p>
            <p>Not afraid to close my eyes</p>
            <p>Life's a game made for everyone</p>
            <p>And love is a prize</p>
            <p>So wake me up when it's all over</p>
            <p>When I'm wiser and I'm older</p>
            <p>All this time I was finding myself, and I</p>
            <p>Didn't know I was lost</p>
            <p>So wake me up when it's all over</p>
            <p>When I'm wiser and I'm older</p>
            <p>All this time I was finding myself, and I</p>
            <p>I didn't know I was lost</p>
            <p>I didn't know I was lost</p>
            <p>I didn't know I was lost</p>
            <p>I didn't know I was lost</p>
            <p>I didn't know</p>
